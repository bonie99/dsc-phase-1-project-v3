## Business Understanding
PROBLEM STATEMENT; The goal is to identify the least risky aircraft for the companyâ€™s new venture, while ensuring it is launched at a competitive and reasonable price. This will help facilitate a successful entry into the market.

Key Stakeholders: Stakeholders will come from a wide range.

Internal: Company stakeholders, potential investors External: Government regulations, competitors (other airline companies), customers Responsibility: Successfully adapting to the aviation industry and selecting aircraft with the lowest risk.

Resources: Industry reports, financial budget, aircraft safety data, and expert consultations.

Risks: Potential for financial losses and safety incidents related to accidents.
## Project Plans & Goals
The aim of my project is to identify the types of aircraft commonly used in business and private enterprises, and to determine number of engines and weather conditions are more prone to accidents . I also seek to understand the nature of accidents.
## Data Analysis
### Data Understanding
My project have information that has previously been collected by varius data scientists. The data is stored in Kaggle whereby it is uptated reguraly, and is stored in a csv format. When I read the data to my notebook using pandas library, I get a dataframe with 90348 rows and 31 columns. From a brief look at the dataframe, we realize that the information we are dealing with is from investigation of aircraft accidents
### data cleaning
After analyzing the data and determining what is essential, it's crucial to understand why certain information is necessary for achieving the "Project goal fulfillment.The significance of this step is to enter the market with a clear, comprehensive, and relevant understanding.varius  columns that were found irrelevant were deleted.

### conclusion:
Based on the comprehensive analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1.Airclafts with 3 engines are the the most safest with the highest percentage of minor damage during accidents as compared to other as seen in the above bargraphs.
2.Boeing mostly suffer minor damanges when crushed as compared to the rest to the rest aircrafts. 3.most of total fatal injuries happened during Unk weather conditions while vmc contributed the least total fatal injuries. 4.majority of accidents contributed to substancial damage while very few contributed to unknown severity of damage

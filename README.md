## Data Understanding
My project involves utilizing data previously gathered by various reaserchers, the data is stored stored on Kaggle and is updated in CSV format. Upon loading the data into my notebook I obtain a dataframe containing 90,348 rows and 31 columns. A quick review of the dataframe reveals that the information pertains to investigations of aircraft accidents.

### conclusion:
Based on the comprehensive analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted, the following conclusions can be drawn:
2.Boeing mostly suffer minor damanges when crushed as compared to the rest to the rest aircrafts. 3.most of total fatal injuries happened during Unk weather conditions while vmc contributed the least total fatal injuries. 4.majority of accidents contributed to substancial damage while very few contributed to unknown severity of damage
3 cessna has the highest number of accidents as compared to others aircraft makers
4 most of total  fatal injuries occured when the weather condition was UNk.
